# Egolution

I wanted to try and write a program that «evolves» through time.

So here it is: you get a genome which is a random string. Your goal in life is to become a better string. A good string has a space every 5 characters or so, doesn't contain punctuation, capital letters or numbers.

You get infected by viruses and your genome is changed. This new genome is tested. If your score is better, you get to keep that genome.

This is my first program in go.
